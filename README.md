Game Server Beans Library (Flex swc)

This library consists of mostly of beans from the original AutoEvony.

It is used as a Flex swc that is wrapped into a loadable SWF application to provide a swappable set of beans so different game servers (other than the original Evony) can be used by Sudo Wars.
